### Pre_Notification
    Please use this commands to make the project runs:
* To install packages required: npm install
* For building mode: npm run build-dev
* For production mode: npm run build-prod
* For Starting the Server: npm run start

### Description

   * This is the 1st Project at the Udacity ND Advanced Web Development Track. It is about using the AI, especially the Natural Language Processing tool to analyse an article.
   * the application is just a one page App, which takes an article URL, and analyse it using an external "MeaningCloud" API for that. The result is shown after processing the article.

### Details

* [hint]: I walked through the classroom code and applied all steps (and of course changed alot of the packages versions to make it work). The I used is as my starter code and completed the requirements.
   * The App consists of:
    * Front-End Part:
      A single page that takes a URL and gives a result from the API

    * Back-End Part:
        The Server is dealing with an external "MeaningCloud" API which analyses the article entered and gives a specific result of that analysis.
